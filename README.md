# App
Checklist for any. App. Ever.

## Motivation
As a full-stack dev, we create app. Then we iterate. Sometimes we want to discover new technologies, and every now and then we lose a lot of time because we're like kids picking up pieces from a giant Lego box. The thing is, no matter what technology you use, there will always be a few things you need to learn when building a wep app.
